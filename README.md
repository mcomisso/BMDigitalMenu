# BMDigitalMenu

##BLUE-MATE?
>BM stands for _Blue-Mate_, an italian startup.

BM is composed by Edoardo Capaldo (designer), Matteo Comisso (me! developer) and Vincenzo Marco Palmieri(designer).

This is the product we built during the last year. Actually, this is the THIRD project we made, but the others are more like proof-of-concept/study than working products.

We were incubated into H-Farm Ventures, a venture capital.
Sadly we didn't get any financial round to continue our dream, but we built this kinda-product that maybe could be useful. We learnt so much from the open source projects that we want to give some cents back.

##SO What
Here's what: this is an iOS framework, build around iBeacon Technology.

This is what we had in mind: why continue to use only the classic sheet of paper, where almost anybody has a smartphone? Why I cannot have a digital menù in my pocket? And what if that menù automatically changes by the places I'm in and matches for me the best recipes together?

So, we made it: this framework enables third parties applications to integrate our work, connected to our backend. **(now offline)**


##Usage

####Libraries
The only way it seemed possible to use external libraries was.. to include them manually. So, no cocoapods (unfortunally).

This project has inside its own libraries of:
- `AFNetworking`
- `SDWebImage`
- `FMDB`
- `BFBMPaperButton`
- `TDBadgedCell`
- `UIImage+ImageEffects`
- `CocoaSecurity` **(Warning, modified version)**
- `UAObfuscatedString`
- `REComposeViewController`
